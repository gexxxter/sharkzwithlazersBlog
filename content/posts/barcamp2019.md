***TL;DR***
I went to [barcamp2019](https://barcamp-kiel.de/) gave talks, met new people and drank a few (a lot) good cocktails.

So last week I was at the Barcamp2019 in Kiel where I had the chance to give two talks.  
It was a blast as always.  
Two days packed with interesting sessions and opportunities to meet new people.  
Below you can see the session grid of the two days.
